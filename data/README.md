## The data files.

These are the QSAR data in the SDF format.SDF is one of a family of chemical-data file formats developed by MDL; it is intended especially for structural information. "SDF" stands for structure-data file, and SDF files actually wrap the molfile (MDL Molfile) format. We use the [chemminer](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ChemmineR/inst/doc/ChemmineR.html) package to manage this format.


1. QSAR_187.sdf contains the 187 compounds we selected through the literature for training the models.
2. 5000compounds.zip, obviously contains 5000compounds.sdf - GitHub limits you to 25MB files
3. 2nd-5000compounds.zip, obviously contains 2nd-5000compounds.sdf- GitHub limits you to 25MB files
