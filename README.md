## QSAR-hiv project 

Despite the significant progress in managing patients infected with HIV through the development of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), big challenges and opportunities remain to be explored. Of particular interest, is the binding of glycoprotein 120 (gp120) to the primary cellular receptor Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4). CD4 induces a significant conformational change in gp120 that facilitates receptor engagement. In this work we describe our  two phased computational process to identify useful compounds capable of binding to the glycoprotein 120 (gp120)  for therapeutic purposes.  Based on the literature, we identify 187 compounds from the ZINC database that conform to active binding sites on these proteins. The data in the form of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) is downloaded and transformed using PCA. In the first phase we develop a neural network model that identifies potential inhibitors from a virtual screen of a subset of the ZINC database. In the second phase we model the top ten compounds using the Discovery Studio docking and screening software. We find those compounds with a LogP value of approx perform well in the binding simulations while the lower scoring compounds do not bind well. The top compounds were then manufactured in the lab and experiments were conducted to ensure bindings to the gp120/CD4 complex succeeded.
